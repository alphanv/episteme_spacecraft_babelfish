A self-contained Colab notebook that implements the core Episteme equations in a simple 1D ecosystem simulation. This will demonstrate the active learning loop with information gain maximization.
This notebook implements a minimal but complete version of the Episteme framework:

True System: A 1D ecosystem with logistic growth dynamics

Agent Components:

Generative model with uncertain parameters

Variational belief updating (Kalman filter-like)

Information gain calculation for active experiment design

Symbolic regression for equation discovery

Babelfish semantic encoder concept

Key Demonstrations:

The agent learns to estimate the true system state despite noise

It selects actions that maximize information gain

It discovers the underlying system equations through sparse regression

The Babelfish module learns a compressed latent representation

The simulation shows how an Episteme-like agent can actively explore and learn about an unknown system, gradually refining its model of the underlying dynamics.
